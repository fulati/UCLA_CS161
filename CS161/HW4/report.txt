1. The graph 1 with k = 3 is UNSATISFIABLE.

2. The graph 1 with k = 4 is SATISFIABLE.

3. The answers of these two SAT instances tell us that graph 1 cannot be solved with 3 colors, because having 3 colors is not enough and that we need at least 4 different colors so that no two connected nodes share the same color. 

One possible assignment is the following: 

Node 1: Color 1
Node 2: Color 3
Node 3: Color 4
Node 4: Color 1
Node 5: Color 2
Node 6: Color 3
Node 7: Color 2

4. 8 colors.
